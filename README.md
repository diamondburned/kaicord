# Kaicord

Minimal Discord client for KaiOS 3.x.

## Credits

Some of the code were taken from
[cyan-2048/Discord4KaiOS](https://github.com/cyan-2048/Discord4KaiOS), namely
the CORS code to bypass the CORS policy on KaiOS.

The library design is heavily influenced by
[diamondburned/arikawa](https://github.com/diamondburned/arikawa).
